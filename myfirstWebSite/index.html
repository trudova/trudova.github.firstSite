            <p>This was a wonderful experience "in" the Garden of the Gods. 
                 Nice yoga practice.  Tabitha was thoughtful and clearly experienced, giving i
                 deas for the beginner and more advanced practitioner.  The 
                only thing I would suggest is to please consider setting up a bit be
                fore the allotted start time.</p>

            <p>We hiked the Crags route to Pikes Peak.  Hike for Life made sure
                 I was prepared ahead of time, continually monitored my health 
                 during the climb and 
                followed up with great pictures.  I highly recommend them.</p>

            <div class="call tell4"><h2><span>Lisa A.</span></sp></h2><br>
            <p>I always had a goal to hike Pikes Peak and found this organization 
                perfect for helping me reach my goal.  I live in Houston so my biggest 
                concern was hiking at a higher elevation, not getting lost, and just to have a safe, 
                 enjoyable experience. Their communication with potential hikers is excellent.</p>
